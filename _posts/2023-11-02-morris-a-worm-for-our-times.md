## Morris - A Worm for Our Times

On this day in history the Morris worm was released onto the Internet, wreaking havoc on a number of systems and becoming notorious as one of the first worms distributed on the net. While _the only crime was curiosity_ at the start, aiming to exploit a number of vulnerabilities and explore possibiltiies, the end result was a damaging viral spread thanks to the effects of including code that directed the software to replicate itself in many systems. The impact was far-reaching with systems being bogged down to an unusable state.

With thousands of systems downed and high removal costs incurred its author Robert T. Morris was tried in the U.S. under the _1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act_ and was its first conviction.

> This isn't a virus. It's a worm!

This may all sound a bit familiar with similarities to the later journeys of some of our own hacking heroes like Dade Murphy and villians like The Plague and his use of the Da Vinci virus. In more than a few ways we owe a debt of gratitude to the trail blazed by the [Morris worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm).
