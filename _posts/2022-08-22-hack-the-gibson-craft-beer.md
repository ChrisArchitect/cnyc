Jolt Cola for those late night hacking sessions and then maybe one of these when things get a bit more _social_. Celebrate those righteous hacks!

> Drinking this beer is a sensory experience akin to flying around inside a giant computer while wearing a super cool eye piece thing and being called a dickweed by the guy from Short Circuit. It‚Äôs got a 28.8 modem and an active matrix display with a million psychedelic colors, a killer refresh rate, and triple the speed of a Pentium. It‚Äôs cooler than Zero Cool himself.
