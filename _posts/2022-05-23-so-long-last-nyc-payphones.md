That particular booth's fate isn't so terrible however, it's going to a new home in the collection of the [Museum of the City of NY](https://www.mcny.org/)!

Pay phones are being replaced by something like this [LinkNYC](https://www.link.nyc/) terminal – a roll-out that's been happening since like 2015. The calls may be free but there will always been new ways to _hack the planet_ of course.

 NYC news site Hell Gate has a nice post about the real story on the ground/underground:
