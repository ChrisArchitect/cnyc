[Appeals Court Overturns Conviction of AT&T Hacker](http://www.wired.com/2014/04/att-hacker-conviction-vacated/)  

> Andrew “Weev” Auernheimer, a hacker sentenced to three and a half years in prison for obtaining the personal data of more than 100,000 iPad owners from AT&T’s unsecured website is about to go free, after a ruling today that prosecutors were wrong to charge him in a state where none of his alleged crimes occurred.

Raises some questions about the line… _“Don’t hack across state lines from your house….”_
