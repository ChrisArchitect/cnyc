A fun mashup of Hackers scenes with the opening theme from _Friends_. Nice job Ryan.

One ponders what the episode titles might be....

* _The One with the 1,507 Systems_
* _The One with the Pool on the Roof_
* _The One with the Hacking Challenge_
* _The One with the Garbage File_
* _The One with the Place Where I Put That Thing That Time_
* _The One where Hackers of the World Unite_
* _The One with the Heinous Scheme_
* etc!
