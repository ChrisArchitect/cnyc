## Just Thought I Would Let You Guys at 2600 Know About This

> **Dear 2600:** 
> 
> Today I was looking to rent the movie _Hackers_ from my local video rental store and to my dismay, they didn’t have it at all. I went across town to an identical store and they didn’t have it either. At this point I was getting suspicious. Why would a video store have so many old and, in my opinion, bad movies, and not have this one movie from less than five years ago? It seemed a little too weird to be a coincidence. I checked two other video stores in my area and after about an hour of searching found it at a Blockbuster. I may just be paranoid but it seems weird that a movie about a group of young “computer enthusiasts” such as ourselves would suddenly disappear from video store shelves soon after Clinton declared war on “cyberterrorism.” My friends think I’m just being paranoid, but I can’t shake the feeling that all such media will slowly be swallowed by the abysmal vortex of ignorance and the public will be uneducated as to the essence of hacking and will only live with the terrible misconception that is infecting our society. I just thought I would let you guys at 2600 know about this, as it could soon become a problem.

Gone are the days of video store woe (depending on how you look at it). Now we have both a number of rights-protected streaming options and some [hard-copy versions](https://88-films.myshopify.com/products/hackers-4kuhd) available.
