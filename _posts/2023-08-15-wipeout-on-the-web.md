## From Club to Console to... Computer Browser

As you may recall, at one time we had a prototype of the video game *wipEout* in the club running on a big screen setup for people to play. The futuristic anti-gravity racing game would go on to great acclaim on game console platforms like PlayStation.

## Play Wipeout on the Web

Fast-forward many years and Dominic Szablewski @phoboslab has delved into video game maker Psygnosis' leaked source code and made it playable right in your computer's web browser.

Now you can live out your high-speed dreams just like Crash & B...err.. Dade & Kate. And remember: the winner (or loser actually) gets to ride off into the night with *Curtis*.

### [Rewriting wipEout](https://phoboslab.org/log/2023/08/rewriting-wipeout)

> The source code for the classic PSX launch title wipEout was leaked in 2022. A few months ago I finally sat down to take a look at it. The result is a (nearly) complete rewrite that compiles to Windows, Linux, macOS and WASM. [**Thanks to WASM and WebGL you can play wipEout right in your browser!**](http://phoboslab.org/wipegame/)
