# Celebrating 27 years

[![Scene from Hackers (1995) with the character Cereal Killer standing outside the Cyberdelia club on a New York City street at night, surrounded by a handful of people holding a cassette tape. "Check this out, each and every one of you. Compilation tape, of my own making. I call this the Greatest Zooks Album. Featuring artists like, well I got some Hendrix on there, some Joplin, Mama Cass, Belushi... all great artists that asphyxiated on their own vomit! Can't get this in stores, man, I made it!"](/images/hackers-cereal-killer-matthew-lillard-greatest-zooks-compilation-tape-outside-cyberdelia-nyc.jpg)](/images/hackers-cereal-killer-matthew-lillard-greatest-zooks-compilation-tape-outside-cyberdelia-nyc.jpg)

Not planning on joining the Greatest Zooks club yet!
