## Okay. Let’s go shopping.

> **DADE**  
> I’ll hack the Gibson.

> **NIKON**  
> They’ll trace you like that. (snaps his fingers)  
> Man, cops are gonna find you, they’re gonna find you with a smoking gun.

> **DADE**  
> Fucked if I care, man.

> **NIKON**  
> Look, even if you had the passwords, it’ll take you ten minutes to get in, and you’ve still gotta find the files, man, I mean, the cops will have you in… five minutes.

> **CEREAL**  
> Oh wow, we are fried.

> **KATE**  
> (suddenly lighter-hearted)  
> Never send a boy to do a woman’s job. With me, we can do it in seven.

> **CEREAL**  
> You’re both screwed. I help, we can do it in six.

> **NIKON**  
> Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help, we can do it in five minutes, man.

> **DADE**  
> _Okay. Let’s go shopping._

> **CEREAL**  
> Woo hoo! Boom!
