In 1983 the BBC had a number of initiatives to promote computer literacy including some television programs and one-off live specials. One such special aired in October 1983, _Making the Most of the Micro Live_. In one segment host Ian McNaught-Davis had John Coll in studio with a BBC Micro computer hooked up to a modem. They wanted to demonstrate a new BT Gold phone network that had electronic mail capabilties by dialing in and accessing the new-fangled "e-mail" service. Little did Coll know but the account password issued to them for their demonstration had been revealed to the studio and some guests up for a laugh got word to some hacking friends outside. Upon connecting to the online service, Coll got a surprise message. Watch the whole sequence from the BBC archives here and see the message below.

The Hackers' Song is great. A classic bit of hacking antics and humor. No harm done really and John Coll kept his cool and carried on with the show like a pro.
