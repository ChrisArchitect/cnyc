## The Joybubbles of Connecting

A new documentary explores the life of Joe Engressia who used his unique whistling ability to find new ways to hack the telephone system. But to Joe it was about so much more than early phone phreaking with that magic tone (2600 Hz if you hadn't guessed). Being born blind it was a comfort and exciting gateway to new connections and opportunities in the outside world. Growing from his pioneering phreaking (inspiring some names along the way like Steve Wozniak and John "Captain Crunch" Draper who appear in the film) he eventually took the name _Joybubbles_ and continued to seek connection and spread joy to others in creative and eccentric ways.
