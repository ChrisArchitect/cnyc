  <img class="figure-img img-fluid" src="/images/payphone-hackers-cyberdelia-sticker-crimestoppers-notice-plants-overrun-wild-phonebooth-cyberdelianyc-site.jpg" alt="A Bell Canada payphone inside a phonebooth, blue plastic top coin deposit, black body and receiver and yellow phonecard slot. It's got some dust and mud marks, not clean. Has a Cyberdelia sticker on its side. A number of green weeds/plants have overgrown into the booth and are creeping up to the base of the mounted phone. A sign above says Bell Crime Stoppers with a Canadian flag. Text: If you know of anyone who is responsible for damage to Bell Canada equipment, or have knowledge of any other crime, call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS. A tree and grass and edge of a brown brick building can be seen in distance behind the booth." loading="lazy">
