Sorry to hear of the passing of journalist Dan McQuade. Known for his Philadeliphia love he also had love for NYC and Hackers once waxing nostalgic about the clothing to the point of recreating Phreak's iconic cat t-shirt with an image of his own pet cat.(pictured) 

RIP Philly legend.

> Dan McQuade, our friend and colleague, died this week at the age of 43. He is survived by his wife and young son. At the end of 2024, Dan was diagnosed with neuroendocrine cancer. The news of his diagnosis hit all of us hard, but Dan never lost his enthusiasm or his spirit.
